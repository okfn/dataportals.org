The website provides a portal for links to data stored on various government departments. There is official intention for all public data to be eventually accessible via this portal but Freedom of Information requests have indicated that different departments have a) varying knowledge of the portal b) varying attitude towards the portal.

The data is NOT open. The government provides its own license that is heavily restrictive and vague. ",,Other (Not Open),,"The license/terms and conditions can be found here: https://data.gov.hk/en/terms-and-conditions

The data is available for commercial and non-commercial use but there are considerable restrictions on both.

Commercially, the data is not allowed to be sold. In theory, if you package the data with an app that is for sale, that would not be allowed. Further, there is a list of allowed commercial uses (see section 9) that focus almost entirely of 'advertisement and promotion' of services. Creating a service out of the data itself is presumably restricted because it falls under the category of re-selling the data. The wording may reflect Hong Kong's complete reliance and focus on property and financial service markets, or it may reflect the government's desire to retain control of the data.

For all users, pay especial consideration to the list of conditions at the end of section 8. For example, ""you shall not use the Data in any inappropriate, ... manner"". The decision on what is inappropriate, of course, lies entirely in the hands of the Hong Kong government and following the typical Chinese model of vague terminology, covers absolutely anything. If your data product brings any potential embarrassment, loss of earnings or discomfort to Hong Kong, its government, its elite or China, then your product will be criminalised.",Hong Kong,"22.3579355,113.9809309",HK,"en, tc, sc",active,,,,,

In short, the One.Stop.Transport platform (OST) is a platform for open data aggregation, transformation and delivery, following modern Open Data principles, standards and directives. It is available online and comprises a development environment for app development alongside simple-to-use RESTful API's for nurturing an open ecosystem on top of open data.

The OST uses open standards for both data and protocols (such as GTFS, GTFS-realtime, DATEX II, OAuth 2.0, W3C Point of interest, W3C widget specification), and provides an open source multi-modal journey planning service (API) which partially covers most of Portugal.

Here is a short presentation in english with some of the highlights (https://speakerdeck.com/brecke/one-dot-stop-dot-transport-presentation), but feel free to ask me anything.",,Other (Open),,"Regarding the open terms, right now all of our data is made available without a proper licence, just a “terms of use” which are shown every time you request a key.

Those are (still) in Portuguese but what it says is that one is free to use data freely in third-party apps and services, and that each provider reserves the right to cancel data providing if some kind abusive usage is detected (none so far, and we’ve been feeding some services and apps for a while).

Our goal has always been to identify and apply standard CC licences to data we make available, because they are clearer to developers and.. well, standard. This is still an ongoing effort though.","Coimbra, Portugal","40.2254686,-8.4522897",PT,,inactive,,,,,

All citizens have the right to access to this information, that can assist in controlling public expenditure, commenting, questioning, promoting and overseeing the spending of public institutions.

The state spends thousands of dollars on new technology platforms that enhance and facilitate the collection of revenue, however, regarding the provision of information on public institutions, their assets and expenditure, there is little information that is dispersed , poorly organized and difficult to access.

Transparency and easy access to information is the first instrument in fighting corruption, so do not understand why there is so much reluctance in most public institutions in providing this information.

It is intended that this project is a platform informative and useful to society. Not wanting to be sensationalist, or party, it is expected that citizens and different stakeholders see it as a support for growth of the country, citizen participation and fair competition in the supply of goods / services to the public sector.

The collection of this information is not always a simple process, and sometimes this is not 100% correct, so it's up to all of us proceed to its validation and require the institutions to provide increasingly, information and more accurate.

At this point is to collect through the site settings Direct base.gov.pt and enterprise data through the site publicacoes.mj.pt.
